Ola Ride-Sharing Trip Clustering
This project analyzes ride-sharing data from Ola to identify patterns in trips based on geographical locations and time of day. Using K-Means clustering, trips were grouped into meaningful clusters, such as school commutes, office rush hours, and leisure trips. The dataset includes 500 records with details like origin, destination, start time, and trip duration.

Key insights include morning clusters (residential to schools/offices), evening clusters (shopping/leisure areas), and peak-hour clusters (office hubs). These findings can optimize resource allocation, predict demand, and enhance user experience. Future improvements include adding features like traffic and weather and exploring advanced clustering methods for deeper insights.
